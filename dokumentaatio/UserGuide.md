**Main menu** 
You can choose from two play styles: single player game against the computer or 2 player game, where you play against a friend. Start the game you have chosen by clicking the button of your choice.

**Placing the ship**
To place your ships you must first choose the ship you want to place from the menu on the left of the game area. The stars indicate the size of the ship you will be placing. You can change the orientation of the ship by pressing the toggle button in the menu. The default setting is horizontal. To place the ship you have chosen you need to click a button in the game area. The button you press will be the starting point of your ship. A horizontally oriented ship will continue to the right and a vertical one will continue down. You cannot place a ship right next to another ship, not even diagonally, or partly (or fully) outside the game area. If this happens you will be greeted by an error message indicating what went wrong. In two player game player 1 places their ships first and player 2 gets their turn after player 1 has pressed "start". To start the gameplay player 2 must also press "start". Both players must have placed all their available ships before the game can move on to either player 2 ship placement or the actual gameplay. 

**Gameplay**
When the game starts Player 1 gets the first turn. The two boards are labelled with the player who should be using that particular board to shoot at their opponent. The labels also indicate whose turn it is at any time. It is not possible to play your turn when it is not your turn. To shoot you click one of the buttons on the board. If you managed to shoot a part of the opponent's ship the square will turn black and you get another turn. Your turn will continue untill you miss. The player who sinks all the opponent's ships first will be the winner. At the end of the game the losing player will be shown the ships, or parts of ships, they did not manage to find. The reavealed parts will be shown in red. You can also choose to start a new game or quit the game in this point.
